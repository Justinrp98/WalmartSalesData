This is a follow-along project which can be found at this link, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr1Go2gP8fo&t=369s

I started this project with some SQL experience already. I used guidance from the creator to create a database in MySQL for this project, and then proceeded to answer most of the questions on my own after having gotten the data into MySQL.

I would still use the creators' code as a guide when needed. You can see "CHECK THIS ONE" written in the comments of the code after problems I had gotten stuck on and needed the extra guidance.

Overall this project helped me understand how to setup MySQL, where I had been using BigQuery in the past to complete Google's Data Analytics Certificate and work through my first practice project.
